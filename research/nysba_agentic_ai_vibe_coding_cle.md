## Significance

This is the **first official state bar association CLE program dedicated to vibe coding for lawyers**. It legitimizes vibe coding as mainstream legal education—signaling that bar associations recognize lawyers need to understand these tools both for:
1. Their own practice efficiency
2. Counseling clients who use these tools

---

## Course Description

> "Artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving from passive tools to autonomous, goal-seeking systems capable of acting on behalf of their users. At the same time, new development paradigms such as 'vibe coding' are changing how software is created, relying on intention, aesthetics, and emotional context rather than traditional logic and rules. These shifts raise urgent questions of liability, duty of care, confidentiality, and professional responsibility."

---

## Target Audience

Legal professionals with **little or no technical background**.

---

## Learning Objectives

1. Define the concepts of agentic AI and vibe coding in plain language suitable for client counseling
2. Identify potential legal risks associated with each, including liability, duty of care, and bias
3. Recognize how existing legal doctrines (agency law, product liability, professional responsibility) may apply to autonomous AI systems

---

## Topics Covered

- Agentic AI systems and autonomous capabilities
- Vibe coding development paradigms
- Application of existing legal frameworks:
  - Contract law
  - Negligence
  - Professional ethics
- Emerging AI regulation

## Key Concepts from Related Article

### Agentic AI
- Independent systems capable of taking actions without constant human direction
- Operate differently from traditional generative AI by having capacity to pursue objectives autonomously
- "Autonomous, goal-seeking systems that can act on behalf of humans"

### Legal and Professional Concerns
- Liability questions for autonomous system decisions
- Standards of care when delegating tasks to AI agents
- Confidentiality safeguards in automated workflows
- Professional responsibility implications for attorneys using such tools

### Vibe Coding
- Intuitive or less formally structured approaches to working with AI systems
- Contrasts with traditional coding methodologies
- Relies on "intention, aesthetics, and emotional context rather than traditional logic and rules"

## Why This Matters for Lawyers

The emphasis is on **proactive education rather than reactive regulation**—helping attorneys develop competency with these tools before widespread adoption creates compliance challenges.

This CLE recognizes that:
1. Lawyers will increasingly use AI agents in their practice
2. Lawyers will counsel clients who use AI agents
3. Existing legal frameworks (agency law, product liability, professional responsibility) need to be adapted
4. "Vibe coding" is becoming a legitimate way for non-technical professionals to build tools
