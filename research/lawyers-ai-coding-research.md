### Professional Education

**[Agentic AI and Vibe Coding for Lawyers - New York State Bar Association](https://nysba.org/products/agentic-ai-and-vibe-coding-for-lawyers/)**

This is a landmark CLE (Continuing Legal Education) course - the first official state bar association program dedicated to vibe coding for lawyers.

**Date:** November 20, 2025

**Target Audience:** Legal professionals with little or no technical background

**Course Description:**
> "Artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving from passive tools to autonomous, goal-seeking systems capable of acting on behalf of their users. At the same time, new development paradigms such as 'vibe coding' are changing how software is created, relying on intention, aesthetics, and emotional context rather than traditional logic and rules. These shifts raise urgent questions of liability, duty of care, confidentiality, and professional responsibility."

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Define the concepts of agentic AI and vibe coding in plain language suitable for client counseling
2. Identify potential legal risks associated with each, including liability, duty of care, and bias
3. Recognize how existing legal doctrines (agency law, product liability, professional responsibility) may apply to autonomous AI systems

**Topics Covered:**
- Agentic AI systems and autonomous capabilities
- Vibe coding development paradigms
- Application of existing legal frameworks (contract law, negligence, professional ethics)
- Emerging AI regulation

**Significance:** This legitimizes vibe coding as mainstream legal education. A major state bar association is now teaching lawyers they need to understand vibe coding both for their own practice efficiency AND for counseling clients who use these tools.

**[The Rise of Vibe Coding: Why Legal Teams Are Quietly Building Their Own AI Tools](https://www.ryanmcdonough.co.uk/the-rise-of-vibe-coding-why-legal-teams-are-quietly-building-their-own-ai-tools-and-what-firms-should-do-about-it/)**
- Key insight: "This isn't classic shadow IT. It's stealth AI."
- "Tools that look like personal projects but perform legal work and sit completely outside governance"
- How it works: "A lawyer opens Claude and types a request for a Python script that processes documents for summarization. Claude writes the script. The lawyer opens GitHub Codespaces or Replit — entirely in the browser, using their personal account."
- Warning: "Legal teams are not trying to bypass rules. They are trying to stay productive in systems that aren't keeping up."

## Reddit & Community Research

### r/legaltech Subreddit

**[Harvey AI Cofounders Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaltech/comments/1pjb3z6/were_winston_weinberg_gabe_pereyra_the_cofounders/)** (via [LawNext coverage](https://www.lawnext.com/2025/12/harvey-cofounders-answer-tough-questions-in-reddit-ama-valuation-competition-and-the-future-of-legal-ai.html))

The r/legaltech subreddit hosted Harvey AI's cofounders for their third vendor AMA. Key highlights:

**On Claude vs Harvey:**
> "A tech-savvy attorney asked what Harvey can do that Claude Opus 4 cannot."

Harvey's response outlined 6 differentiators:
1. Better AI for legal through singular industry focus
2. Making entire legal teams more effective on matters
3. Deep integrations with legal tech ecosystems
4. Integration with internal law firm systems
5. Governance features (ethical walls)
6. Workflow builders (no-code), APIs, and MCPs for custom integrations

**On Lawyers Building Tools:**
> "Harvey already provides workflow builders (no-code), APIs, and MCPs (Model Context Protocols) to support firms building custom integrations."

**Team Composition:**
> "About 20% of Harvey's team are lawyers... lawyers and engineers work side-by-side on everything from workflow design to evaluating new model performance."

### Notable Lawyer-Coder: Tom Martin

**[Hands-On AI: Lawyers Should Learn to Code](https://www.lawdroidmanifesto.com/p/hands-on-ai-lawyers-should-learn)** - LawDroid Manifesto

Tom Martin is a self-taught lawyer-coder who learned BASIC, HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and Python. He built "AI Python Tutor" - a tool using GenAI for one-on-one Python tutoring.

Key quote addressing lawyer resistance:
> "Tom, I'm a lawyer, not a programmer! I don't have time to learn to code on top of everything else I have to do."

His response: Coding isn't about becoming a full developer - it's about understanding how AI tools work to use them more effectively.

### Reddit Sentiment on Claude vs ChatGPT for Coding

From various Reddit discussions:
> "Claude smokes GPT4 for Python and it isn't even close on my end. I'm at 3,000 lines of code on my current Fusion 360 plugin."

> "With ChatGPT I usually have to tweak and critique the code to fit my project. Not so with Claude. Claude's code writing seems to be completely different than ChatGPT's."

### Community Resources

- **r/legaltech** - Primary subreddit for legal technology discussions, hosts vendor AMAs
- **Slack groups** - Product-specific communities (Afterpattern, Documate, docassemble)
- **Resources for Legal** - Group for sharing tech and non-tech resources for lawyers

### Key Insight from Reddit Research

Reddit discussions on lawyers + AI coding are **sparse but growing**. The most substantive content is in r/legaltech, which focuses more on enterprise legal AI (Harvey, CoCounsel) than individual lawyers vibe coding. The "vibe coding" term hasn't penetrated Reddit legal communities yet - they're more likely to discuss "no-code" or "workflow automation."

## Key Themes

### 1. Early Adoption Phase
- Lawyers using Claude Code are outliers, not mainstream
- Most legal AI discussion focuses on document generation, not building tools
- "Zero coding background" users are succeeding with vibecoding

### 2. Disruption Anxiety vs. Opportunity
- "RIP most legal work" sentiment generating strong reactions
- Some lawyers see AI as existential threat to transactional practice
- Others positioning as AI+legal consultants

### 3. Access to Justice Angle
- AI tools filling gap for clients who can't afford traditional legal services
- Democratization of basic legal knowledge

### 4. Legal-Specific Tools Emerging
- eDisco CLI shows legal professionals building domain-specific AI tools
- Opportunity for lawyers to build internal tooling with AI assistance

### 5. Training Market Emerging
- @AI_for_Lawyers and similar consultants training law firms
- Growing demand for "how to use AI safely in legal practice"

## Key People to Follow

| Person | Handle | Focus |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Greg Yates | @AI_for_Lawyers | Training lawyers on AI |
| Andrew S. Bosin | @AndrewBosin | SaaS/AI law firm |
| Ross Guberman | @legalwritingpro | Legal writing + AI |
| Joël Niklaus | @joelniklaus | Legal NLP research |
| BowTiedStingray | @BowTiedStingray | Lawyer using Claude Code |

## Conclusion

The intersection of lawyers and AI coding tools like Claude Code is nascent but growing. The most compelling finding is **BowTiedStingray** - a lawyer with zero coding background actively using Claude Code to build tools for their small law firm. This represents the early adopter segment that could expand significantly as vibecoding tools mature.

The viral "Claude vs. $5,000 lawyer" post (686K views) indicates strong public interest in AI disruption of legal services, though the legal community's response is mixed between enthusiasm and concern.

For anyone building legal AI tools, the opportunity appears to be in:
1. Training lawyers to use existing AI tools safely
2. Building legal-specific CLI tools (like eDisco CLI)
3. Bridging the gap between AI-generated legal content and professional review
