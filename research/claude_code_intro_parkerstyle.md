Team,

I wanted to share something I've been using for the last few months that has genuinely changed how I work. It's called Claude Code <https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview>, and while it was originally built for software developers, I think it's the most important AI tool for lawyers right now.

The basic idea is simple. Instead of using AI in a browser window where you upload documents and copy-paste outputs, Claude Code runs directly on your computer. That means it can read files in your folders, write new documents, and search through materials without you manually selecting what's relevant. Point it at a folder full of prosecution files or discovery documents, ask a question, and it finds what it needs.

But here's what makes it actually transformative: it can spawn copies of itself. Imagine reviewing a complaint, identifying ten legal issues that need research, and then having all ten research threads running simultaneously – each writing its own memo. One lawyer directing a small army of AI researchers. I use this almost every day now and it feels like a superpower.

You may have seen Andrej Karpathy's post last week <https://x.com/karpathy/status/2004607146781278521>. He's a founding member of OpenAI, former head of AI at Tesla, and generally considered one of the most important people in the field. Here's what he said:

*"I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. Clearly some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession."*

If Karpathy feels behind, we're in good company. But also – if he thinks this is important, it probably is.

A quick story. My wife works in medical affairs for a device company. She manages a registry of patient data and used to work with a biostatistician to analyze it. I gave her a one-day intro to Claude Code. She doesn't need the biostatistician anymore. Her company just got an FDA label extension – allowing their device in new patient populations – based entirely on analysis she did with Claude Code. She back-tested it against years of prior work. Perfect matches.

She doesn't know how to code. Neither do I, really. I haven't written any meaningful code in the last year – Claude does that for me.

**On confidentiality** – I only use this for non-confidential work. Public patent prosecution, published filings, regulatory materials. But a surprising amount of what we do falls in that bucket. For confidential work, the path forward is clearer than you might think (ZDR terms, local processing, perimeter controls), but that's a longer conversation.

**On those legal AI products we keep hearing about** – Harvey, CoCounsel, Lexis+AI – they're all essentially wrappers around these same foundation models, packaged with a UI and sold at a premium. Which is fine. But the thing I keep coming back to is this: Claude Code can build its own tools. Need a capability that doesn't exist? Describe it, and Claude Code makes it. I built a patent prior art cross-referencing tool in an afternoon. No IT tickets, no vendor demos.

Ethan Mollick made a similar point recently <https://x.com/emollick/status/1937345809990791513>: buyers should understand that most AI vendors are just building prompts around one of a few foundation models. The limitations of their product are the limitations of that underlying model. Something to keep in mind.

Anyway, I've attached a Getting Started guide that walks through installation. It assumes no technical background. If you have an hour this week, I'd suggest just pointing it at a folder of documents and seeing what it can do. Build intuition before trying anything ambitious.

Happy to walk through any of this in person if that would help.

Thanks,
